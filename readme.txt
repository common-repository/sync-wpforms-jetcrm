Use WPForms to collect leads info and save time by automating your lead generation process.

== Description ==

## This plugin converts form-fillers into customers in your database!

> Automatically create leads from the WPForms form completions.

A form is much more than an email hole. A form is a portal, (stick with me on this), it's a way that a totally distant person can reach you, simply by them entering their details.

What's more, that person could become a **customer**... But only if the process is managed. That's why **Jetpack CRM** *and* **WPForms Forms** are a supreme business-system match.
